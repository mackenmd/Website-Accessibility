>> Joe Kuperman: So there's a lot of different screen readers, so for those of you that are front end developers, get used to another frustrating thing where not everything works the same on all these different platforms. So there's a bunch of different screen readers for different operating systems and they all work mostly the same.

[00:00:17]
But really often we get, like when I worked at Twitter, we got like, okay it's like Jaws but its like five versions ago that has the problem and people are like. [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] It's the same with browsers but they work mostly the same like everything we're talking about today is universal but when you get into like some really advanced stuff The screen writers can work a little bit differently.

[00:00:40]
I can't think of a really good example right now, but we will get into some, similar to different browsers. So Jaws, ZoomText, so if you have Mac you can turn your screen right around with command f5. But keep your volume down right now. And it'll turn on voice over for mac which is which is really really great.

[00:01:02]
We're gonna be using ChromeVox. Specifically because it's built by them into the browser not the operating system. So no matter what operating system you run if you wanted to download Chrome you can follow along perfectly, but yeah. I really like voice over and I really like jaws. If I'm on Windows.

[00:01:19]
So those are my recommendations. If you wanted to go out at expense one at your work and start screen readering everything.
>> [LAUGH]
>> Joe Kuperman: VoiceOver's free. It's Mac only.
>> Speaker 2: NVDA is also free, whereas JAWS is pretty expensive, so.
>> Joe Kuperman: Right. Yeah, I'd say it probably, at least in my experience, I only get Jaws when I get a report for Jaws if somebody's like we're trying to use.

[00:01:42]
At Twitter we had a Jaws report, so we expensed a copy of Jaws and NVDA is great. Honestly, for all the stuff we're doing today, it's universally shared. It's very much like CSS with a browser. Where you're pretty much all good and then once in a while something is just not gonna work on one of the browsers.

[00:01:59]
So yeah, anybody who wants to jump ahead we're gonna be using ChromeVox. It's in the Google Chrome Store. Yeah, it's not my favorite screen reader but it's really nice that you can use that in the operating system.
