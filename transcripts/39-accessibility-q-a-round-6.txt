[00:00:00]
>> Speaker 1: Cody points in the chat, the can I use ha sa partial support for Aria.
>> Jon Kuperman: Yeah, okay. Yeah. [LAUGH] That's a good point. Yeah. Aria in general, it's a big speck with a lot of different things in it, and a lot of is, I'm not exactly sure why this happens.

[00:00:18]
But a lot of it is left up to discretion for the screen readers, for the device, which is where I think the stuff that we covered today is pretty safely universal. But when you get in to some more of the complex stuff, the support is pretty all over the place.

[00:00:35]
A lot of the basic stuff with ARIA was made to fill in gaps that didn't exist in html, and a lot of that's supported but Aria has a ton of different stuff. Screen readers are private. Company is not really held to much. It's kind of like the old days of the browsers where there wasn't really all that much reason to follow the spec as much as, just do your own thing.

[00:00:57]
But, in my experience, Doing the things that we've covered here has really, really wide support with the different screen readers. That being said, I have run into a few weird bugs where it's been on a specific version of JAWS that doesn't handle something the same way. I would definitely say all the things that we covered today, skiplinks and all the roles and everything like that, that's going to be very well supported.

[00:01:24]
Q18 uses browser stack for testing devices.
>> Speaker 3: Is there something equivalent for screen readers?
>> Jon Kuperman: I don't think there is. Yeah, I really don't think there is. I mean, you can get a lot from the static analysis tools, a lot of good stuff, this is a bad label, but that's not really using a screen reader.

[00:01:45]
So, they have the two things that there aren't. There's no screen reader API at all and then, there's no automated actual screen reader testing tools that I've seen. But you can get pretty far with hooking up and Ally. One of those linters.
>> Speaker 1: Again, from Ben Are there any certain methods of authentication that work better for people with disabilities?

[00:02:09]
For examples, are passwords ever a problem. Are there any methods that are strongly preferred, and are there better ways to implement to FA, to factor authentication.
>> Jon Kuperman: Okay, so, a big one that comes to mind right away is, like the difficulty with some of the anti-spam stuff, like Captchas that i mentioned.

[00:02:27]
So if you have Captchas they can be really problematic for users with disabilities. As far as 2FA goes, it's really interesting. I haven't seen anything done in that realm specifically. I don't think there is much. You have a screen reader on your phone just as well as you have a screen reader on your computer, so if it's logging in from the computer and sending a text message, that's still very doable.

[00:02:56]
But I haven't seen any accessibility specific to FA stuff. And then as far as log-ins and passwords go, I think really, I mean following a few of the things that we covered, like rolls, labels, descriptions and then just a good U I is definitely enough. The two factor one interests me.

[00:03:14]
I would definitely like to do a little bit more research, and if there's any accessibility preferences were two factor off. But I haven't seen anything like that.
>> Jon Kuperman: I don't know if you have.
>> Speaker 4: I saw a presentation given last year at the season conference which is an international disabilities conference by a couple of accessibility professionals at AT&T.

[00:03:38]
And it was generally about security. And they touched on two factor auth And there were two concerns that they brought up in general. One which was, because you may have someone with the disability, who's using assistive technology, let's say on their desktop computer.
>> Jon Kuperman: Uh-huh.
>> Speaker 4: But they're being required to use two factor auth on their phone It may actually be physically difficult for them to move

[00:04:06]

>> Jon Kuperman: Sure.
>> Speaker 4: Between those two devices and especially if there's a timer between when the first action and the second should have to be completed.
>> Jon Kuperman: Right.
>> Speaker 4: The other thing was, that you have to ensure that both of the devices that you're putting them in the position to have to use, that those experiences are both fully accessible as well.

[00:04:27]

>> Jon Kuperman: Right. Yeah, so I think that the most common approach being like, you get a text message to your phone. I mean the first one's definitely an issue. But in a similar sense, it's the same issue for everyone, right? Which is kind of the point of the two FAs, that you have to stop what you're doing and switch devices.

[00:04:46]
But a text message would be fully accessible for people on the phone. One thing I might look into huluauthenticator and duosecurity. Are those accessible apps? So, if instead of a text message if you're requiring the user to unlock their phone, go to an authenticator and generate a token, then go back.

[00:05:04]
So, that would be I guess a concern around 2FAs if you recommend an authenticator app, making sure that it itself is accessible. I do think it's something to be aware of, that you're asking potentially a lot from users, but on the other hand, in a sense, that's kind of the whole point of the extra authentication layer is that You know, by its very nature it has to be a second device, it has to be a second Also, CSUN is awesome.

[00:05:30]
If you all get a chance to go, it's quite good. It's like, I think, the biggest accessibility conference of the year. There's always really great talks.
>> Speaker 5: Can you say that name again, please?
>> Jon Kuperman: CSUN. C-S-U-N.
>> Speaker 4: It's California State University at Northridge. And they have an international accessibility conference every year, last few years it's been down in San Diego.

[00:05:51]

>> Speaker 5: So, is there an acronym for the actual conference?
>> Speaker 4: CSUN.
>> Speaker 5: That's the school.
>> Speaker 4: Well, yes, if you google CSUN-
>> Jon Kuperman: I think at this point the conference has outranked the school as far as, but yeah, here. I mean if you just.
>> Speaker 5: I heard CSUN I'm like I got the school that's all I got.

[00:06:10]

>> Jon Kuperman: Gotcha. Yeah, it's quite good. They always have people that are doing really cutting age stuff, really interesting stuff.
