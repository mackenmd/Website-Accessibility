>> Jon Kuperman: So finishing up, the three things I would recommend everybody do today, tomorrow, whatever, to your site, is grab one of those tools and run an audit. So whether it's the Chrome Dev Tools, Firefox Dev Tools, or one of those third party ones. Check the color schemes that you use, both on web and then also on your physical media.

And the community, I really just can't say enough about the accessibility community. I think there's just something in the nature of doing good work that makes people really friendly. But I've been a part of a lot of different CSS and JavaScript communities before, and nobody's been as friendly as the accessibility community.

There's a lot of cool meetups going on, even if they're smaller in a lot of areas. I'm not sure about this area, but I know in California we have a couple of different accessibility meetups. There's some really good conferences that happen every year. And then there's just a ton of really nice people online, people I mentioned Rob Dodson, he works at Google doing a bunch of accessibility.

Marcy Sutton, she works at a private company called Deque that does a bunch of accessibility stuff. Yeah, just like, a lot of really great people, whether it's Twitter, Meetup, however you reach out.
